    <h1>The Fox and the Goat</h1><br>
    <P>One hot summer day, a thirsty fox wandered into a farmer’s field.
         He saw a well with a bucket hanging from a rope. He ran towards it and looked inside.
          He was delighted to see some water at the bottom of the well. 
          He jumped into the bucket and let it take him down to the water.
           He drank his fill and felt very refreshed. But then he realized that he had no way to get out of the well.
            The bucket was too heavy for him to lift, and the walls of the well were too slippery for him to climb.
         He began to panic and curse his own foolishness.<br>
         Meanwhile, a goat came along and saw the well. He was also very thirsty and wanted to drink some water. He peered into the well and saw the fox. He asked him what he was doing there.<br>

The fox, who was a cunning animal, quickly thought of a plan to escape. He said to the goat, “I came here to drink this delicious water. 
It is the best water I have ever tasted. You should try some too. There is plenty for both of us.”<br>

The goat, who was very naive and gullible, believed the fox. He said, “How can I get down there?”<br>

The fox said, “It’s easy. Just jump into the bucket and it will take you down. Then you can drink as much as you want.”<br>

The goat did as the fox said. He jumped into the bucket and it started to go down. As it did, the bucket with the fox in it started to go up. The fox was overjoyed. 
He reached the top of the well and jumped out. He said to the goat, “Thank you, my friend, for saving me. You are very kind and generous. But I must warn you, this well belongs to a farmer who is very cruel and greedy.
 He will not let you out. He will either kill you or sell you to someone else.
 You should have been more careful and not trusted strangers.
 Goodbye and good luck.”<br> <br><br>
 </P>

    <p>The fox ran away, leaving the goat alone in the well. The goat realized that he had been
         tricked and regretted his stupidity. He began to cry and bleat, hoping that someone would hear him and help him.
          But no one came. He was doomed to die in the well.

    <h1>The Grasshopper and Owl</h1><br>
    <p>
The Fainthearted Rabbit Story
The Fainthearted Rabbit Story for Kids
Once an owl was fast asleep in the hollow of a tree. A grasshopper came there,
 sat on a branch and started singing loudly. The owl could not bear the loud singing of the grasshopper. 
 He came out of his hollow and requested the grasshopper, “My dear friend, your singing disturbs my sleep.
  Will you please stop singing?
 You may go somewhere else and sing.”<br><br>
</p>

<p>
The grasshopper said, “I never stopped you from sleeping. Why do you stop me from<br>
singing? I will continue to sing today.” The grasshopper was in a fine mood to sing<br>
that day. He knew that the owl would not be able to catch him because the owl could not see during the day. So the grasshopper continued his singing.<br>

The owl thought, “This grasshopper appears to be a hard nut to crack! He will not listen to my request. I should think of some other way to teach him a lesson.”<br>

As the grasshopper continued his singing, the owl said, “Dear grasshopper! I never knew you could sing so sweetly. Today, I feel that instead of wasting my time sleeping, I should sit awake here and listen to your sweet voice. I was under<br>
the impression that only the cuckoo had a sweet voice. But I was wrong! Your voice is, indeed, the sweetest.”<br>

The grasshopper was flattered by the praise. He said proudly, “Hey owl! At last, you have learnt to appreciate good music. Now listen to me carefully. Oh! Unfortunately, if my throat gets dry, there is no water here. But never mind. Today I will sing specially for you.”<br>

The owl said, “I have never had the opportunity to listen to such a sweet song. I am<br>
lucky that a great singer like you has come to my door to sing for me. And please do not worry. There is enough water in the hollow. After you finish singing, you may come here and drink water.”<br>

The grasshopper started singing loudly. He sang until his throat became dry. When he finished singing, the owl said, “Please come here and drink some cool water. Your throat will feel better.”<br>

The grasshopper flew into the hollow of the tree to drink water. The owl was waiting for this very moment. As soon as the grasshopper entered the hollow, the owl caught him in his beak and swallowed him. Then the owl went to sleep peacefully.<br>
